## Description

This is a repository containing the practice and excercises from Code Academy. In this section I practiced Object Oriented Programing (OOP) and creating Classes. 

## Objects.js

This is a file where I practice creating JS Classes. In this example we create a class HospitalEmployees which constructs the name and remaining vacation days. This class also contains a static method which is only accessible to this class. Followed by creating a Nurse class which inherits from the HospitalEmployee class. Great example of showing how to save having a code duplication in the program. 

## Build A Library

This is a Code Academy excercise which helps practice creating Classes in JS.

## Description

This is a repository containing the practice and excercises from Code Academy. In this section I practiced Object Oriented Programing (OOP) and creating Classes.

## Objects.js

This is a file where I practice creating JS Classes. In this example we create a class HospitalEmployees which constructs the name and remaining vacation days. This class also contains a static method which is only accessible to this class. Followed by creating a Nurse class which inherits from the HospitalEmployee class. Great example of showing how to save having a code duplication in the program.

## Build A Library

This is a Code Academy excercise which helps practice creating Classes in JS. First creating the Media class which is used to create create properties which are common with other classes. Made from title, isCheckedOut, and ratings. These are also properties which are used in all other classes. Next created a Book class which inherits from the Media class. There are additional properties which are author and number of pages. Last created a Movie class which also inherits from the Media class and adds director and runTime properties. All the classes had been tested and are working correctly.

## School Catalouge

This is a Code Academy excercise which is used to practice creating new classes. In this assignment I created a School class which has main propeties which other classes are inhereting from School. Then create a Primary School which had an additiona property of pick up policy. Also created a High School class which inherits from School. This class has an additional property of high school teams. In this excercise I practiced creating new class which have properties, methods, and static methods. Tested the application and it all works.
